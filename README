This demo has only been tested with chrome 10. It may work with older versions of chrome, and some features do not work with firefox 4.0 (skill drag & drop). You will probably need to download a beta of a recent browser to see this demo: <a href="http://khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation">getting a WebGL Implementation.</a> If you need information about this demo, you can contact me : nicolas dot bonnel at gmail dot com.
