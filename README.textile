Welcome to the WebGL Action RPG GitHub's page !

This is a no-class action role playing game (RPG). See game mechanism in the wiki.

The online demo is available "here":http://nicolas-bonnel.github.com/WARPG/index.html

This game requires a webGL compatible web browser. It has only been tested with chrome 10 and firefox 4. It may work with older versions of chrome, and some features do not work with firefox 4.0 (particle system based on sprites). You will probably need to download a beta of a recent browser to see this demo. "Getting a WebGL implementation.":http://khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation

If you need information about this demo, you can contact me : nicolas dot bonnel at gmail dot com. The code is licenced under GNU GPL 3. Feel free to reuse the code, credits would be appreciated.

Any help would be appreciated, see the wiki to see how you to contribute.
